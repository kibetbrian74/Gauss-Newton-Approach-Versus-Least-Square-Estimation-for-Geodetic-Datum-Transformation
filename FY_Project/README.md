In the README file, I must mention that the scripts you are seeing under the "first_repo" Repository were my final-year project activities.
I was doing a project titled "Empirical Analysis of the Seamless 3D Datum Transformation using Statistical Techniques"

Programming Language is MATLAB
Data Initialization contains scripts that convert raw data from degrees minutes seconds format to measurements whose units are meters
The coordinates were then split into two: 
      Training data (70%): To be used in the determination of datum transformation parameters
      Testing data (30%): Data which will be transformed from one datum to the next (for this case, Clarke 1880 to WGS 1984)
