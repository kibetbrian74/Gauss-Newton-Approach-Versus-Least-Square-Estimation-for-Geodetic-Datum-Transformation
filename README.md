This project is titled: **Empirical Analysis of the Seamless 3D Datum Transformation using Statistical Techniques**

Data Initialization contains scripts that convert raw data from degrees minutes seconds format to measurements whose units are meters.
The coordinates were then split into two: Training data (70%): To be used in the determination of datum transformation parameters 

and Testing data (30%): Data which will be transformed from one datum to the next (for this case, Clarke 1880 to WGS 1984)

**Note**

std1 - standard deviation,
stde1 - standard error
